# SpaceX 
SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. 
It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars whereas other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.  To do this, we can use public data and machine learning models to predict whether SpaceX – or a competing company – can reuse the first stage.
# The problems included:
Identifying factors that influence the landing outcome
The relationship between each factor and affection to the outcome
Best predictive model for predicting if the first stage will land
